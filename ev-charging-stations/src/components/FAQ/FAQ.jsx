      question: "How long does it take to charge an electric vehicle?",
      answer: "Charging time depends on the type of charger and your vehicle's battery capacity. Level 1 charging (120V) can take 8-20 hours for a full charge, Level 2 (240V) typically takes 4-8 hours, while DC Fast Charging can provide 80% charge in 20-30 minutes."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does it cost to charge an electric vehicle?",
      answer: "The cost varies based on electricity rates and charging location. Home charging typically costs $0.10-$0.20 per kWh, while public charging stations may charge $0.30-$0.60 per kWh. On average, it's significantly cheaper than gasoline."
    },
    {
      question: "What types of charging connectors are available?",
      answer: "Common connectors include Type 1 (J1772) for Level 1/2 charging, CCS Combo for DC fast charging, CHAdeMO for Japanese vehicles, and Tesla's proprietary connector. Most new vehicles in North America use CCS Combo."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I install a home charging station?",
      answer: "Yes, most EV owners can install a Level 2 home charging station. You'll need a 240V outlet and may require an electrician for installation. Check with your local utility for possible rebates or incentives."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I find charging stations while traveling?",
      answer: "Our app helps you locate nearby charging stations. You can filter by charging speed, connector type, and availability. The app also shows real-time status and user reviews."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the range of electric vehicles?",
      answer: "Modern EVs typically offer 200-400 km (125-250 miles) of range on a full charge. Some premium models can exceed 500 km (310 miles). Range varies based on driving conditions, speed, and weather."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I maintain my EV's battery?",
      answer: "Best practices include keeping the battery between 20-80% charge for daily use, avoiding extreme temperatures when possible, and following the manufacturer's maintenance schedule. Fast charging should be used sparingly."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any government incentives for EV ownership?",
      answer: "Many governments offer incentives such as tax credits, rebates, and reduced registration fees for EV owners. Check with your local and national government websites for current programs."
